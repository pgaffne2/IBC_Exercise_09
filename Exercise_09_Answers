#Question 1

#read data from NEA Change vs Fat gain file
sd <- read.csv("IBC_Exercise_09_Scatterplot_Data.csv")

#create scatterplot
plot(sd[,1], sd[,2], type="p", xlab="NEA Change (Cal)", ylab="Fat Gain (kg)")

#add trendline
abline(lm(sd[,2] ~ sd[,1], data=sd), col = "blue")



#Question 2
library(ggplot2)
dat <- read.csv("data.txt")

#barplot
ggplot(dat, mapping = aes(x=region, y=observations)) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(fill=region), data = dat, stat = "summary", fun.y = "mean") + theme_classic()

#scatterplot
ggplot(dat, mapping = aes(x=region, y=observations)) + geom_jitter() + theme_classic()

#The barplot and scatterplot do provide different insights into the data.
#The barplot shows that the means of the four populations are approximately equivalent, at around 15.
#However, the scatterplot shows that the observations are distributed very differently within each population.
#For example, the range of observations in the east region is approximately 0 to 35, while the range of those in the north region is from about 13 to 17.
#The barplot does not reflect these differences among the groups.
